            "question": "How can I incorporate PrEP into my routine?",
            "answer": "You can try to take PrEP at the same time as another daily activity, like brushing your teeth or having breakfast. This can help make it a habit. You can also keep your medication in a place where you'll see it, like next to your toothbrush or on your nightstand, so it reminds you to take it. Something that could also be helpful is using a weekly pill organizer that can help you remember if you've taken your dose each day. If you travel a lot, get a portable pill organizer so you can easily take your medication with you."

        "Adherence_to_PrEP_medication": {
            "question": "How important is adherence to PrEP medication?",
            "answer": "Adhering to PrEP medication, whether oral or injectable, is crucial for its effectiveness. Consistent use ensures sufficient medication levels to prevent HIV, with daily PrEP being about 99% effective. Building a routine helps maintain this protection, while regular use and follow-ups allow for managing side effects and health monitoring. If you miss a dose of oral PrEP, take it as soon as you remember, but if it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed one and continue with your regular schedule. For injectable PrEP like Apretude, sticking to the injection schedule—initially two injections a month apart, then every two months—is vital. Missing or delaying injections can lead to lower drug levels in your body and increase the risk of getting HIV. Even though there might be some leftover protection after the last injection, it's not clear how long it lasts. Low levels of the drug can also increase the chance of HIV becoming resistant to the medication if you get infected during this time. That's why it's very important to stick to the schedule to keep yourself protected and healthy."

        "missing_doses_on_PrEP": {
            "question": " What should be done if a PrEP dose is missed?",
            "answer": "For Daily PrEP (Truvada or Descovy), take the missed dose as soon as you remember, but not if it's close to your next dose. Aim for at least four pills a week.\nFor Injectable PrEP (Cabotegravir), contact your healthcare provider to get a prescription for oral PrEP and reschedule your next injection. For On-Demand PrEP (2-1-1 Dosing), take the missed doses as soon as possible and follow the remaining schedule. Consistent use is crucial, so consult your healthcare provider if you frequently miss doses."

            "question": "Are there any concerns about developing resistance to PrEP?",
            "answer": "The risk of drug resistance from PrEP is low when used correctly and with regular HIV testing. To avoid resistance, ensure you are HIV negative before starting PrEP, re-test for HIV if you take a break or before restarting, and take PrEP exactly as prescribed without missing doses."
